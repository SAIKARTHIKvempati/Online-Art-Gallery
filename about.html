        The purpose of the Art Vista Image Gallery is to allow prospective customers the ability to sell and purchase
        Art. The Online Art Gallery also contains special functionality that is not viewed in many other Art
        Gallery websites. The ability to extract a color specific to the pixels of the image uploaded by the
        customer. Once the color is determined via a pixel sorting algorithm, a string representation of the color is
        submitted to the database allowing the customer the ability to search for a specific type of Artwork based
        on the color they typed. The Online Art Gallery is also object oriented allowing streamlined data flow
        between the User Interface Layer, Business Logic Layer, and Data Access Layer. Permissions are also
        enforced for security purposes with the Online Art Gallery consisting of three main users which are
        gallery, seller and buyer. Gallery serves as an administrator of the website and can manage sellers, buyers,
        and transactions. The gallery user will have all the authority to manage the transations and track the
        transactions of the seller and buyer. The gallery user can also add and delete the seller and buyer.
        Additionally specifc security protocols are set in place for specific functions within the application for
        secure data flow of sensitive information provided by the customer. Sellers and buyers can sell and buy
        Artwork respectively.
